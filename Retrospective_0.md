- [Quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [General assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
- Total points committed vs. done 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing: 0
- Code review completed: 0
- Code present on VCS: 1-2-4
- End-to-End tests performed: 0

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |        |            |              |
| _#1_   |         |        |            |      5h      |
| _#2_   |         |        |            |              |
| _#3_   |         |        |            |              |   
| _#4_   |         |        |            |   1d 1h 45m  |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0
  - Total hours spent: 0
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 0 
  - Coverage (if available): 0%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 0
  - Total hours spent: 0
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 0
  - Total hours spent: 0
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - The team did not estimate the time for debugging testing.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - The team should manage the division in tasks in a better way and have a better meeting at start. 

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - A better coordination between members and task assignment. Testing time and code review estimation. The team can achieve these with longer meetings for sprint planning

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - The group is technically balanced. Everyone, individually, has good skills and did his job. Everyone has been available to make change to his own code.
